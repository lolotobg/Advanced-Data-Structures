# Advanced-Data-Structures

 - Some **not-so-good** (or particularly well documented for that matter) implementations of several **not-so-trivial** data structures.
 - Written in *Java* or *C++* (may require *C++11* compilation).
 - Some even contain comments and the Java ones usually contain at least some amount of *unit tests*.


Most of the code is written as homework assignments for the 3633 "Advanced Data Structures" elective discpiline read in the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics (FMI) of Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski" in тхе summer semester of 2014/2015.
